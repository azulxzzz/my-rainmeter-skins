# my-rainmeter-skins
A collection of my rainmeter skins

# To install
Just download the entire repo as a zip and extract it with 7-Zip which should be installed. I included the latest version of Rainmeter in the repo as an exe so install that first. Then once its installed and running you can double click in each .rmskin file to install the skins one at a time. Use the rainmeter dashboard to configure your skins. You can also configure most skins using the notepad. Youtube will show you everything.
